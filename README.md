# üö¶ SCAD: Surveillance Curated Accident Dataset and X3D-Based Detection

> Official repository for **‚ÄúFrom Chaos to Detection: Accident Benchmarking in Surveillance Videos with a Curated Dataset and 3D CNN.‚Äù**  
> This project introduces **SCAD**, a *clean, reproducible*, and *benchmark-ready* dataset for accident detection in surveillance videos, alongside a **lightweight X3D-based 3D CNN** reference model.

---

## üìò Overview  
SCAD addresses a critical problem in existing anomaly-detection datasets: contamination from *scene duplication, annotation artifacts, and cross-partition overlap* that lead to inflated benchmark metrics.  
We curate and clean multiple public surveillance datasets to build a balanced, transparent, and ready-to-train accident detection benchmark.

**Key Features:**
- üßπ **High-quality clips** ‚Äî 513 accident and non-accident scenes, filtered and segmented  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Lightweight model** ‚Äî based on X3D, suitable for limited compute  
- üß™ **End-to-end pipeline** ‚Äî segmentation ‚Üí training ‚Üí testing ‚Üí inference  
- üîç **Transparent benchmarking** ‚Äî no cross-over contamination, reproducible splits

## üé¨ Dataset Description

SCAD is constructed from multiple established public datasets. Each video is subdivided into **4-second clips**, overlapping by **3 seconds**, ensuring full capture of events. We carefully remove duplicates and cross-dataset overlaps to preserve benchmark integrity.

| Source | Reference | Role in SCAD |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **CADP** | IEEE AVSS 2018 | CCTV-based traffic accident dataset |
| **So-TAD** | Neurocomputing 2025 | Surveillance-oriented traffic anomaly dataset |
| **TU-DAT** | Sensors 2025 | Road traffic anomaly dataset |
| **UCF-Crime** | CVPR 2018 | General anomaly dataset containing accidents |

> **Usage**: SCAD is provided for **academic research only**. When you use the dataset or model, please cite both this repository and the corresponding paper (once accepted).

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Segment Raw Videos  
Use the segmentation script:

```bash
python segment.py
Before running, edit:

python
Copy code
# segment.py
input_folder  = "videos/"  
output_folder = "accident/"
This script outputs 4-second clips into anomalous/ or normal/ subfolders.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Train/Test Splits
Create the files:

accident_train.txt

accident_test.txt

Each line should list a clip path relative to accident/, e.g.:

bash
Copy code
anomalous/clip_001.mp4  
normal/clip_145.mp4  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the X3D Model
Run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Within train.py, configure:

python
Copy code
main_folder  = "accident/"  
train_split  = "accident_train.txt"  
test_split   = "accident_test.txt"
You can also adjust: input size, frame count, sampling rate, learning rate, optimizer, pretrained checkpoint, etc.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate Model
Run:

bash
Copy code
python test.py
Edit:

python
Copy code
dataset_folder = "accident/"  
test_split     = "accident_test.txt"  
model_path     = "84.48model.pth"
5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Inference
Run:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py
It automatically segments incoming frames and outputs alerts when it detects anomalous (accident) events.

üß† Model & Architecture
Backbone: X3D (efficient spatio-temporal architecture)

Framework: PyTorch

Input: RGB frame sequences

Output: Binary classification (accident / non-accident)
