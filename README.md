# üß† SCAD: Surveillance Accident Detection Benchmark

## üìò Overview
Current anomaly detection benchmarks often suffer from **scene duplication**, **annotation artifacts**, and **cross-partition overlaps**, which artificially inflate model performance.  
**SCAD** (Surveillance Curated Accident Dataset) addresses these flaws by providing a **curated, transparent, and ethically cleaned dataset** that enables true benchmarking in accident detection.

## üîë Highlights
- üßπ **Clean & verified dataset** ‚Äî 513 labeled accident and non-accident clips  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Lightweight 3D model** ‚Äî X3D-based for efficient training on modest GPUs  
- üß™ **End-to-end pipeline** ‚Äî segmentation ‚Üí training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí inference  
- üîç **Reproducible splits** ‚Äî zero cross-contamination between train/test data

## üé¨ Dataset Description
The SCAD Dataset was meticulously constructed from multiple public surveillance datasets.  
Each raw video was **segmented into 4-second clips (with 3-second overlap)** to ensure complete scene coverage while maintaining clip balance.  
All redundant and overlapping frames were removed to preserve **benchmarking purity**.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### üß© 1. Segment Raw Videos
Generate 4-second overlapping clips from long videos.

python segment.py
Edit paths inside segment.py:

python
Copy code
input_folder  = "videos/"
output_folder = "accident/"

### üßæ 2. Prepare Train/Test Splits
Create two text files in your main dataset folder:

accident_train.txt
accident_test.txt

Each line should specify the relative path of a clip:
anomalous/clip_001.mp4
normal/clip_145.mp4

### üß† 3. Train the X3D Model
Fine-tune the pretrained X3D model on SCAD.

python train.py

Edit these variables before training:
main_folder  = "accident/"
train_split  = "accident_train.txt"
test_split   = "accident_test.txt"

You can also modify:
Input resolution
Frame sampling rate
Optimizer and learning rate
Pretrained checkpoint path

### üß™ 4. Evaluate Model Performance

python test.py

Edit inside test.py:
dataset_folder = "accident/"
test_split     = "accident_test.txt"
model_path     = "84.48model.pth"

### ‚ö° 5. Real-Time Inference

Run detection on live or recorded video.
python inference.py
The script continuously processes frames and prints an alert when anomalous activity (accident) is detected.

### üß† Model & Architecture

Component	Description
Backbone	X3D (efficient spatio-temporal CNN by Facebook AI)
Framework	PyTorch
Input	RGB frame sequences
Output	Binary classification (accident / non-accident)

Two pretrained models are included for immediate benchmarking:

Model	Resolution	Frames	Description
81.9model.pth	128√ó128	30	Baseline model
84.48model.pth	182√ó182	25	Enhanced configuration

üîó Related Work
The SCAD implementation draws inspiration from prior work in spatio-temporal event detection, notably extending ideas from the STEAD repository by A. Gao, adapting them for curated accident detection and fair benchmarking.
